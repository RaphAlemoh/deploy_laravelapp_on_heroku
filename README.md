Edit
Using fee based production environment for testing is quite expensive for a project that's most likely isn't a paid one probably trying to build up a portfolio as a developer to show case your skills to the world. There are quite a number of platforms that can be use for testing apps with the feel of a production environment but in this article we'll be hosting laravel application on Heroku with database.

Glad right!!! Let's get started

Heroku is a Platform as a Service cloud computing system that can be used to deploy applications similar to production servers. It enhances continuous integration and continuous deployment to keep the project updated with the local machine or Github repository.

Imagine using a command as simple as git push master heroku to make changes to a live website so the client can be kept abreast with the development and updates of the product. Super cool right?

In this tutorial we'll be creating a basic authentication app using laravel. Heroku has support for PHP application hence we can deploy the laravel application without the tussle of server configuration.
